# Colorful Star Drawing Program

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a colorful star. Each leg of the star is drawn with a different color, creating a visually appealing and vibrant design.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need to have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed on your computer. Python is a widely used, high-level programming language, and the Turtle module is included in the standard library.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/Sourav-1710/Research-Repository/tree/main)
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current directory to the one where you've cloned the repository.

    ```bash
    cd colorful-star-drawing
    ```

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script to draw the colorful star.

    ```bash
    python colorful_star.py
    ```

4. **Enjoy the Art**: Sit back and enjoy the colorful star as it's drawn on the screen.

## Customization
